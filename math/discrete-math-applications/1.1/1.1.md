## Exercise 1

P = Proposition
NP = Not a proposition
T = True, F = false

a) PT
b) PF
c) PT
d) PF
e) NP (unknown variable)
f) NP (does not assert anything)

**PERFECT**

## Exercise 3

a) Mei doesn't have an MP3 player
b) There is pollution in new Jersey
c) 2 + 1 != 3
d) The summer in Maine is neither hot nor sunny 

**WRONG**
d) It is not the case that the summer in Maine is hot and sunny. In other words, the summer in Maine is not
hot and sunny, which means that it is not hot or it is not sunny. It is not correct to negate this by saying
"The summer in Maine is not hot and not sunny." [For this part (and in a similar vein for part (b)) we need
to assume that there are well-defined notions of hot and sunny; otherwise this would not be a proposition
because of not having a definite truth value.]

## Exercise 10

a) The election is not decided
b) The election is decided or the votes have been counted
c) The election is not decided and the votes have been counted
d) If the election is decided then the votes have been counted
e) If the election is not decided then the votes have not been counted
f) If the votes have not been counted then the election is not decided
g) The election is decided if and only if the votes have been counted
h) The votes have not been counted or the election is not decided and the votes have been counted

## Exercise 11

a) p^q
b) p^¬q
c) ¬p^¬q
d) p∨q
e) p -> q
f) (p∨q)^(p->¬q)
g) p<->q

**PERFECT**

## Exercise 17

a) F
b) T
c) T
d) T

**PERFECT**

c) Since the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is false, this conditional statement is true. Note that the
conditional statement is false in both part (b) and part ( c); as long as the hypothesis is false, we need look
no further to conclude that the conditional statement is true.

## Exercise 29

a) 4 - p | q | ¬p | p → ¬p 
b) 9 - p | q | r | s | ¬r | ¬s | (p ∨ ¬r) | (q ∨ ¬s) | (p ∨ ¬r) ∧ (q ∨ ¬s)
c) 9
d) 8

**ALL WRONG - misread rows to columns... **
I read somewhere than most of the mistakes appears when students misread the problem
