## How did I learn Golang

The code I copied from the book Go in practice in order to learn Go.
Copying existing code and reviewing it from time to time is pretty effective. At least to learn the syntax.

Working on side projects at the same time is the practice side.

Interesting parts:

**Lightweight cli app**:

gnuflag/flag.cli
go-flags/hello_cli.go
02-hello_cli/count_cli.go

**Yaml configuration file**

05-yaml_config/yaml_config.go
