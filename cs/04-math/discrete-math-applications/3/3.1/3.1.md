# Exercise 1

List all the steps used by Algorithm 1 to find the maximum
of the list 1, 8, 12, 9, 11, 2, 14, 5, 10, 4.

The algorithm will go through every element of the set

1. max = 1
2. max = 8
3. max = 12 
4. max = 12
5. max = 12
6. max = 12
7. max = 14
8. max = 14
9. max = 14
10. max = 14

The final result is 14

**PERFECT**

# Exercise 3

Devise an algorithm that finds the sum of all the integers in a list.

procedure sum-list(a1, a2 , . . . , an: integer)
r = a1
for i := 2 to n
   r += ai
return r
