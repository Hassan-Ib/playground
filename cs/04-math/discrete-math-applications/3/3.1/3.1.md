# Exercise 1

List all the steps used by Algorithm 1 to find the maximum
of the list 1, 8, 12, 9, 11, 2, 14, 5, 10, 4.

The algorithm will go through every element of the set

1. max = 1
2. max = 8
3. max = 12 
4. max = 12
5. max = 12
6. max = 12
7. max = 14
8. max = 14
9. max = 14
10. max = 14

The final result is 14

**PERFECT**

# Exercise 3

Devise an algorithm that finds the sum of all the integers in a list.

procedure sum-list(a1, a2 , . . . , an: integer)
r := a1
for i := 2 to n
   r += ai
return r

**PERFECT**

# Exercise 5
Describe an algorithm that takes as input a list of n integers in nondecreasing order and produces the list of all values that occur more than once. (Recall that a list of integers is nondecreasing if each integer in the list is at least as large as the previous integer in the list.)

procedure find-double(a1, a2 , . . . , an: integer)
for i := 2 to n
    if ai-1 = ai then add ai to the list m
return m
{m is the list of every double integers of the list a)

**WRONG**
