# Exercise 5
Describe an algorithm that takes as input a list of n integers in nondecreasing order and produces the list of all values that occur more than once. (Recall that a list of integers is nondecreasing if each integer in the list is at least as large as the previous integer in the list.)

procedure find-double(a1, a2 , . . . , an: integer)
for i := 2 to n
    o := false
    if ai-1 = ai 
        for i:= 0 to length m
           if mi = ai 
             o := true
        if o = false
            then add ai to the list m
return m
{m is the list of every double integers of the list a)
