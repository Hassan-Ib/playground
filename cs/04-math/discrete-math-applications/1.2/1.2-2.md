# Second try

Second try on some exercises I was wrong

## Exercise 21

A says “I am a knave or B is a knight” and B says nothing.

Let's assume that p is "I am a knave" and q "B is a knight". To express the problem in a propositional statement, p ∨ q.

Now imagine I am really a knave, hence p is true. In that case I would lie on the fact that I am a knave and claim I am a knight. It's a contradiction, thus ¬p is true and I am a knight.
Since I am a knight, I'm not lying, that is p ∨ q and ¬p must be true so q is true.

## Exercise 3

g: “You can graduate”
m: “You owe money to the university”
r: “You have completed the requirements of your major,”
b: “You have an overdue library book.”

g -> (r ∧ ¬m ∧ ¬b)

## Exercise 19 

A says “At least one of us is a knave” and B says nothing.

Let's assume that A is a knave. In that case the statement "At least one of us is a knave" is false, that is both A and B are a knight. If it was the case, A would not lie by saying that A or B is a knave. This is a contradiction, A and B can't be both knave.

Since B doesn't say anything, B could be a knave. Therefore A is a knight and B is a knave.
