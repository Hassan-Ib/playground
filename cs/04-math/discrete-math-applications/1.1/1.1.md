## Exercise 1

P = Proposition
NP = Not a proposition
T = True, F = false

a) PT
b) PF
c) PT
d) PF
e) NP (unknown variable)
f) NP (does not assert anything)

**PERFECT**

## Exercise 3
What is the negation of each of these propositions?

a) Mei has an MP3 player.
b) There is no pollution in New Jersey.
c) 2 + 1 = 3.
d) The summer in Maine is hot and sunny.

a) Mei doesn't have an MP3 player
b) There is pollution in new Jersey
c) 2 + 1 != 3
d) The summer in Maine is neither hot nor sunny

**WRONG**
d) It is not the case that the summer in Maine is hot and sunny. In other words, the summer in Maine is not
hot and sunny, which means that it is not hot or it is not sunny. It is not correct to negate this by saying
"The summer in Maine is not hot and not sunny." [For this part (and in a similar vein for part (b)) we need
to assume that there are well-defined notions of hot and sunny; otherwise this would not be a proposition
because of not having a definite truth value.]

## Exercice 7

Suppose that during the most recent fiscal year, the annual revenue of Acme Computer was 138 billion dollars
and its net profit was 8 billion dollars, the annual revenue
of Nadir Software was 87 billion dollars and its net profit
was 5 billion dollars, and the annual revenue of Quixote
Media was 111 billion dollars and its net profit was
13 billion dollars. Determine the truth value of each of
these propositions for the most recent fiscal year.

a) Quixote Media had the largest annual revenue.

b) Nadir Software had the lowest net profit and Acme
Computer had the largest annual revenue.

c) Acme Computer had the largest net profit or Quixote
Media had the largest net profit.

d) If Quixote Media had the smallest net profit, then
Acme Computer had the largest annual revenue.

e) Nadir Software had the smallest net profit if and only
if Acme Computer had the largest annual revenue.

ACME computer annual revenue: 138 billion dollars (ar)
ACME computer net profit: 8 billion dollars (an)

Nadir Sofware annual revenue: 87 billion dollars (nr)
Nadir Sofware net profit: 5 billion dollars (nn)

Quixote Media annual revenue: 111 billion dollars (qr)
Quixote Media net profit: 13 billion dollars (qn)

a) qr > ar ∧ nr 
111 > 138 ∧ 87 FALSE

b) (nn < an ∧ qn) ∧ (ar > nr ∧ qr)
(5 < 8 ∧ 13) ∧ (138 > 87 ∧ 111) TRUE

c) TRUE

d) TRUE (conditional statement FALSE -> TRUE)

e) TRUE <-> TRUE so TRUE

**PERFECT**

## Exercise 10

a) The election is not decided
b) The election is decided or the votes have been counted
c) The election is not decided and the votes have been counted
d) If the election is decided then the votes have been counted
e) If the election is not decided then the votes have not been counted
f) If the votes have not been counted then the election is not decided
g) The election is decided if and only if the votes have been counted
h) The votes have not been counted or the election is not decided and the votes have been counted

## Exercise 11

a) p^q
b) p^¬q
c) ¬p^¬q
d) p∨q
e) p -> q
f) (p∨q)^(p->¬q)
g) p<->q

**PERFECT**

## Exercise 17

a) F
b) T
c) T
d) T

**PERFECT**

c) Since the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is false, this conditional statement is true. Note that the
conditional statement is false in both part (b) and part ( c); as long as the hypothesis is false, we need look
no further to conclude that the conditional statement is true.

## Exercise 29

a) 4 - p | q | ¬p | p → ¬p 
b) 9 - p | q | r | s | ¬r | ¬s | (p ∨ ¬r) | (q ∨ ¬s) | (p ∨ ¬r) ∧ (q ∨ ¬s)
c) 9
d) 8

**FIXED - misread rows to columns... **
I read somewhere than most of the mistakes appears when students misread the problem. Like I did... a lot of times.

## Exercise 45

Fred is happy: 0,8
John is happy: 0,4

The truth value of the negation of a proposition in fuzzy
logic is 1 minus the truth value of the proposition. What
are the truth values of the statements “Fred is not happy”
and “John is not happy?”

Fred is not happy: 1 - 0,8 = 0,2
John is not happy: 1 - 0,4 = 0,6

**PERFECT**

## Exercise 47
The truth value of the disjunction of two propositions in
fuzzy logic is the maximum of the truth values of the two
propositions. What are the truth values of the statements
“Fred is happy, or John is happy” and “Fred is not happy,
or John is not happy?”

Fred is happy, or John is happy: 0,8
Fred is not happy, or John is not happy: 0,6

**PERFECT**
