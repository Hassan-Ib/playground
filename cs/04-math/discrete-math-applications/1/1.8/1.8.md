# Exercise 1

Prove that n square + 1 ≥ 2 raised to the power of n when n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 4.

We will use a proof by exhaustion:
1^2 + 1 ≥ 2^1 = 2 ≥ 2
2^2 + 1 ≥ 2^2 = 5 ≥ 4
3^2 + 1 ≥ 2^3 = 10 ≥ 8
4^2 + 1 ≥ 2^4 = 17 ≥ 16

This prove that n square + 1 ≥ 2 raised to the power of n is true.

# Exercise 3

Prove that if x and y are real numbers, then max(x,y) +
min(x,y) = x + y. [Hint: Use a proof by cases, with
the two cases corresponding to x ≥ y and x < y, respec-
tively.]

We will use a prove by case. There are two possible cases:

The first case is when x ≥ y. In that case, max(x,y) + min(x,y) becomes x + y
The second case is when x < y. In that case, max(x,y) + min(x,y) becomes y + x

Since we know that the two operands in an addition can be switched, that is x + y = y + x and that
we covered every possible cases, we can conclude that max(x,y) + min(x,y) = x + y is always true.
