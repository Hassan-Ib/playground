# Exercise 1

1. Translate these statements into English, where the domain
for each variable consists of all real numbers.

a) ∀x∃y(x < y)
b) ∀x∀y(((x ≥ 0) ∧ (y ≥ 0)) → (xy ≥ 0))
c) ∀x∀y∃z(xy = z)

a) For all real numbers x it exists at least one real number y such as x is less than y.
b) For all real numbers x and for all real numbers y if x is greater or equals to 0 and if y is greater or equal to 0 then x by y is greater or equals to 0. Or more simply the product of non negative number has a non negative results.
c) For all real numbers x and all real numbers y there is at least one real number z which is equals to the product of x and y
