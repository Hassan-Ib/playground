# Exercise 1

1. Translate these statements into English, where the domain
for each variable consists of all real numbers.

a) ∀x∃y(x < y)
b) ∀x∀y(((x ≥ 0) ∧ (y ≥ 0)) → (xy ≥ 0))
c) ∀x∀y∃z(xy = z)

a) For all real numbers x it exists at least one real number y such as x is less than y.
b) For all real numbers x and for all real numbers y if x is greater or equals to 0 and if y is greater or equal to 0 then x by y is greater or equals to 0. Or more simply the product of non negative number has a non negative results.
c) For all real numbers x and all real numbers y there is at least one real number z which is equals to the product of x and y

# Exercice 11 

Let S(x) be the predicate “x is a student,” F(x) the predicate “x is a faculty member,” and A(x,y) the predicate
“x has asked y a question,” where the domain consists of
all people associated with your school. Use quantifiers to
express each of these statements.

a) Lois has asked Professor Michaels a question.
b) Every student has asked Professor Gross a question.
c) Every faculty member has either asked Professor
Miller a question or been asked a question by Professor Miller.
d) Some student has not asked any faculty member a
question.
e) There is a faculty member who has never been asked
a question by a student.
f) Some student has asked every faculty member a question.
g) There is a faculty member who has asked every other
faculty member a question.
h) Some student has never been asked a question by a
faculty member.

a) ∃x∃y(A(S(x),F(y)))
b) ∀x∃y(F(s(x),F(y)))
c) A(∀y, F(y)) ∨ A(F(y), ∀y)
d) ¬A(∃xS(x) -> F(y))
e) ¬∀x∃y(A(F(x), F(y))
f) ∃x∀y(A(F(x), F(y)))
g) ∃y∀y(A(F(x), F(y)) ∧ (x != y))  
h) ∃x∀y(A(F(y), F(x)))

**WRONG**
