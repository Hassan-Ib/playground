## Exercise 1

List the members of these sets.
   a) {x | x is a real number such that x^2 = 1}
   b) {x | x is a positive integer less than 12}
   c) {x | x is the square of an integer and x < 100}
   d) {x | x is an integer such that x^2 = 2}

a) {-1,1} **FIXED (WRONG 2)**
b) {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11} **FIXED**
c) {0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81} **FIXED (WRONG 2)**

## Exercise 7

For each of the following sets, determine whether 2 is an
element of that set.

d) {{2},{{2}}}
e) {{2},{2,{2}}} 

d) 2 is not an element of the set. The elements of the set are sets themselves. 2 is a number, not a set. **FIXED**
e) no (for the same reasons as d) **FIXED**

## Exercise 11 

Determine whether each of these statements is true or
false.

b) {x} ⊆ {x} 
e) ∅ ⊆ {x} 

b) TRUE. Every set is the subset of itself. **FIXED**
e) TRUE. An empty set is subset of every set. **FIXED**

## Exercise 21

Find the power set of each of these sets, where a and b are distinct elements.

a) {a} 
b) {a,b} 
c) {∅,{∅}}

a) {∅,{a}} **FIXED**
b) {∅,{a},{b},{a,b}} **FIXED** 

c) {∅,{∅}} **WRONG 2**
c) {∅,{∅,{∅}}} **WRONG 3**
c) {∅,{∅},{∅,{∅}},{{∅},∅}} **WRONG 4**
c) {∅,{∅},{∅,{∅}}} **WRONG 5**

## Exercise 23

. How many elements does each of these sets have where a and b are distinct elements?

b) P ({∅,a,{a},{{a}}})
c) P ( P (∅))

b) 2 ^ 4 = 16 **FIXED**
c) 2 ^ 1 * (2 ^ 1) = 4 **WRONG 2**
c) 2 ^ 0 + (2 ^ 1) = 3 **WRONG 3**
