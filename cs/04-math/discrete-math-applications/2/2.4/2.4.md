# Exercise 1

a)a0
b)a1
c)a4 
d)a5

a) 2·(−3)^0 + 5^0 = 3 **PERFECT**
b) 2·(−3)^1 + 5^1 = -1 **PERFECT**
c) 2·(−3)^4 + 5^4 = 81 + 625 = 706 **WRONG**
d) 2·(−3)^5 + 5^5 = -1 = 241 + 3125 = 3366 **WRONG**

# Exercise 5

List the first 10 terms of each of these sequences.

a) the sequence that begins with 2 and in which each
successive term is 3 more than the preceding term

b) the sequence that lists each positive integer three
times, in increasing order

c) the sequence that lists the odd positive integers in in-
creasing order, listing each odd integer twice

d) the sequence whose nth term is n! − 2^n

e) the sequence that begins with 3, where each succeed-
ing term is twice the preceding term

f) the sequence whose first term is 2, second term is 4,
and each succeeding term is the sum of the two pre-
ceding terms

g) the sequence whose nth term is the number of bits
in the binary expansion of the number n (defined in
Section 4.2)

h) the sequence where the nth term is the number of let-
ters in the English word for the index n

a) 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29 (an = an-1 + 3) **PERFECT**
b) 1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4 **PERFECT**
c) 1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9 **PERFECT**
d) -1,-2,-2,8,88,656 ... **GOOD**
e) 3,6,12,24,48, ... (an = an-1 * 2) **GOOD**
f) 2,4,6,10,16 ... (an = an-1 + an-2) **GOOD**
g) Didn't see that yet... **WRONG**
h) 3,3,4,4,4,3,5,5,4,3 **WRONG**

# Exercise 9

Find the first five terms of the sequence defined by each
of these recurrence relations and initial conditions.

a) an = 6an−1 , a0 = 2
b) an = a^2n−1 , a1 = 2
c) an = an−1 + 3an−2 , a0 = 1, a1 = 2
d) an = nan−1 + n^2 an−2 , a0 = 1, a1 = 1
e) an = an−1 + an−3 , a0 = 1, a1 = 2, a2 = 0

a) 2,12,72,432,2592 **PERFECT**
b) 2,4,16,256,65536 **PERFECT**
c) 1,2,5,11,26 **PERFECT**
d) 1,1,6,27,204 **PERFECT**
e) 1,2,0,1,3 **PERFECT**

# Exercise 11

 Let an = 2^n + 5 · 3^n for n = 0,1,2,....

a) Find a0, a1, a2 , a3, and a4 .
b) Show that a2 = 5a1 − 6a0 ,a3 = 5a2 − 6a1 , and
a4 = 5a3 − 6a2 .
c) Showthata n = 5a n−1 − 6a n−2 forallintegersnwith
n ≥ 2

a) 
a0 = 1+5 * 1 = 6
a1 = 2 + 15 = 17
a2 = 49
a3 = 143
a4 = 421

**PERFECT**

b) 

a2 = 5a1 − 6a0 = 5*17 - 6*6 = 49
a3 = 5a2 − 6a1 =  5*49 - 6*17 = 143
a4 = 5a3 − 6a2 = 5*143 - 6*49 = 421

**PERFECT**

c) **WRONG**

# Exercise 17

Find the solution to each of these recurrence relations and
initial conditions. Use an iterative approach such as that
used in Example 10.

a) an = 3an−1 , a0 = 2
b) an = an−1 + 2, a0 = 3
c) an = an−1 + n, a0 = 1
d) an = an−1 + 2n + 3, a0 = 4
e) an = 2an−1 − 1, a0 = 1
f) an = 3an−1 + 1, a0 = 1
g) an = nan−1, a0 = 5
h) an = 2nan−1, a0 = 1

**TO REDO**

a)
a1 = 3*2 = 6 = 2x3^1 = a0*3
a2 = 3*3*2 = 18 = 2x3^2 = (an-2) * 3^n
a3 = 3*3*3*2 = 54 = 2x3^3 = (an-2) * 3^n

an = 3an-1 = a0 * 3^n = 2*3^n

**GOOD**
