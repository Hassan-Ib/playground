# Exercise 5

Find the domain and range of these functions. Note that
in each case, to find the domain, determine the set of
elements assigned values by the function.

a) the function that assigns to each bit string the number
of ones in the string minus the number of zeros in the
string

b) the function that assigns to each bit string twice the
number of zeros in that string

c) the function that assigns the number of bits left over
when a bit string is split into bytes (which are blocks
of 8 bits)

d) the function that assigns to each positive integer the
largest perfect square not exceeding this integer

a)
Domain: Any bit strings **FIXED**
Range: Integers **FIXED**

b) 
Range: Positive integers with 0 **WRONG 2**

c) 
Domain: Any bit string **FIXED**
Range: Z+ Positive integers **WRONG 2**


# Exercise 7

Find the domain and range of these functions.

a) the function that assigns to each pair of positive integers the maximum of these two integers

b) the function that assigns to each positive integer the number of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 that do not appear as decimal digits of the integer 

c) the function that assigns to a bit string the number of times the block 11 appears

d) the function that assigns to a bit string the numerical position of the first 1 in the string and that assigns the value 0 to a bit string consisting of all 0s


b) Domain: Every positive integers **FIXED**

c) Range: Real Numbers **FIXED**

d) Range: Real Numbers **FIXED**
