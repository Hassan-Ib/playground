# Exercise 1

Let A =
⎡ 1 1 1 3 ⎤
| 2 0 4 6 |
⎣ 1 1 3 7 ⎦
 .
a) What size is A?
b) What is the third column of A?
c) What is the second row of A?
d) What is the element of A in the (3, 2)th position?
e) What is A^t ?

a) The size of A is 3x4 **PERFECT**
b) The third column is (1 4 3) **PERFECT**
c) (2 0 4 6) **PERFECT**
d) 1 **PERFECT**
e) At is an element of the matrix A **WRONG**

# Exercise 7

Adding two matrices is adding every element of the matrix. If all element of the matrix O are equals to 0, then every element of A will be added to O when doing 0 + A.b
Addition is commutative, therefore O + A = A + O. Every element of A are added to 0, thus A = O + A = A + O.

**GOOD**

# Exercise 11

If the product AB and BA are defined, it means that the number of element in a row of A is equal to the number of elements in a column of B. The inverse is as well true. Therefore, both A and B are square matrices.

**WRONG**
