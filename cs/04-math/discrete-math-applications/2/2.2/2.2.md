a) A ∩ B
b) A ∪ B
c) A − B 
d) B − A

a) Students who live within one mile of school and who walk to class.
b) Students who live within one mile of school or who walk to class
c) Students who live within one mile of school and don't walk to class

# Exercise 3

Let A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {0,3,6}. Find:

a) A ∪ B. 
b) A ∩ B.
c) A − B. 
d) B − A.

a) {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
b) {3}
c) {1,2,4,5}
d) {0,6}

# Exercise 5

Prove the complementation law in Table 1 by showing
that the complementary of the complementary of A = A

The complementary of A is everything which is not in A, that is the whole universe U - A. The complementary of U - A is everything which is in A but not in the universe, therefore A.
We can state the problem in a different way:

complementary of the complementary of A = {x | ¬(¬xεA)} = {x | xεA}
