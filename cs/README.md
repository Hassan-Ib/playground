This is my attempt to learn computer science in order to have a deeper knowledge about computing.

It's based on: [Teach yourself computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming)

I wrote about my learning methods, if learning computer science is useful [here](https://thevaluable.dev/learning-computer-science-software-developer/).

Results:

* **WRONG** - Exercise tried once with wrong result. If after two times the result is still wrong, the number near **WRONG** will increase for each wrong attempt.
* **FIXED** - Exercise **WRONG** the first time and retried some time later with good result (results in \*-2.md files). The number attached to it is  be the number of attempts before it has been fixed.
* **GOOD** - Solution found but with some help or with a result very close to the solution, without being exactly it...
* **PERFECT** - Solution found the first time with a result very close to the solution.
