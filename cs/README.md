This is my attempt to learn computer science in order to have a deeper knowledge about computing.

It's based on: [Teach yourself computer science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming)

I wrote about my learning methods, if learning computer science is useful [here](https://thevaluable.dev/learning-computer-science-software-developer/).

Results:

* **WRONG** - Exercise tried once with wrong result. If after two times the result is still wrong, the number near **WRONG** will show the number of time tried in total (2 is the first one appearing, then 3 and so on).
* **FIXED** - Exercise **WRONG** the first time and retried some time later with good result (results in \*-2.md files).
* **GOOD** - Solution found but with some help or with a result very close to the correction without being exactly it...
* **PERFECT** - Solution found the first time with a result very close of the solution.
