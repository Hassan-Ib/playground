; right-split and up-split can be expressed
; as instances of a general spliî€¼ing operation. Define a pro-
; cedure split with the property that evaluating

(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))

; produces procedures right-split and up-split with the
; same behaviors as the ones already defined.

(define split ())
