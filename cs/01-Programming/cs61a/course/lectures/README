This directory contains a number of directories whose names correspond
to sections of Abelson and Sussman.  For example, 1.3 is a directory
whose files contain examples we used in class to illustrate ideas from
section 1.3 of the book.

Individual files whose names end in .scm are readable by Scheme.
(Notice that all English text in any such file is preceeded by one or
more semi-colons (;).  The rest of the line after a semicolon gets
ignored by the interpreter.)  For example, you can try out the
make-adder code by typing (within Scheme):

> (load "~cs60a/lectures/1.3/make-adder.scm")

The load itself just returns #f, but all of the definitions in that
file have now been read, so you can play around with them.  Try, for
example,

> (sum 1 5 (make-adder 2))

Some of the files in this directory are text.

These are notes for various supplementary lectures
(not all are so summarized, however.)
